With over nine years of dedicated experience, primarily with leading organizations like Cognizant, I bring a unique blend of strategic insight, technical proficiency, and a proven track record of driving operational excellence and business growth.
My Master of Science in Information Technology from Annamalai University laid a strong foundation, which I have consistently built upon through extensive professional experience. In my current and previous roles as a Process Specialist and Training Specialist at Cognizant, I’ve honed my abilities in customer support for Google Ads Billing, team leadership, process optimization, and stakeholder consultation. I am particularly proud of my work in leveraging Generative AI LLMs to create hyper-personalized learning experiences, significantly boosting operational efficiencies – a forward-thinking approach I believe would be invaluable to your team.
My professional expertise aligns closely with the responsibilities you’ve outlined. I have a robust background in Google Ads operations as a vendor, specializing in end-to-end campaign management, optimization, and troubleshooting. My commitment to excellence is reflected in my consistent achievement of SLAs and a First Call Resolution (FCR) rate above 90%. I excel at translating complex business goals into actionable Google advertising strategies and have a passion for fostering team development through comprehensive training and coaching.
Beyond my core competencies in customer support, technical assistance (Phone/Chat/Email), and business analysis, I possess a broad range of skills including:
Digital Marketing Mastery: Google Ads (all campaign types), Google Analytics, GTM, Google Search Console, SEO, and performance marketing.
Cloud Architecture & Technical Support: Microsoft Azure (AZ-303, AZ-305 Architect), AWS Solutions Architect - Associate, Google Cloud Platform Architect (GCP), and comprehensive IT support and troubleshooting.
I am eager to bring significant value to your organization by applying my diverse skill set, relevant experience, and passion for innovation. My ability to lead, mentor, optimize processes, and deliver exceptional results, especially within the digital advertising landscape, makes me confident that I can make an immediate and lasting contribution to your team.
Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications and how I can contribute to your company's success in an interview.
